Makers of the Environment is part of an information model whose foundation is a printed book. Some might call it a building information model, but book information model is probably more accurate. The goal is to represent the complexity and power of information modeling technologies and processes within what has up to now been a linear media. Today, information modeling is taking hold in the built environment, the man-made part of the world.

The built environment provides the setting for human activity; ranging from buildings to neighborhoods to cities, and including infrastructure, such as transportation, water and energy networks and other things that relate to humans over time. The ability to interact with everything in the built environment is the most compelling aspect of the information that surrounds us. Easily using the distributed, multidimensional tools and processes that connect data from multiple sources is not a dreamâ€¦ people are doing it today. Collaborative processes, rich data repositories and advanced graphics are the seeds of this information revolution. Properly applied, the tools that make this transformation possible are straightforward and accessible. Anyone can apply them to their benefit.
